Ribbit - libgit2 bindings in Ruby
===================================

Ribbit is a Ruby bindings to the libgit2 linkable C Git library. This is
for testing and using the libgit2 library in a language that is awesome.

INSTALLING AND RUNNING
========================

First you need to install libgit2:

  $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/libgit2.git
  $ cd libgit2
  $ make
  $ make install

Now that is installed, you can install Ribbit:

  $ git clone git://github.com/schacon/ribbit.git
  $ cd ribbit/ext
  $ ruby extconf.rb
  $ make
  $ ./test.rb

That's as far as I've gotten for now.  However, it does load libgit2
and at least run something from the library.


TODO 
==============

I would like the Ruby bindings to keep up to date with the libgit2 
progress.  Any functionality in libgit2 should be accessible from 
Ruby as well.  For an API reference, examples and progress, see the 
API document.
